Ego and programming Response:
1. Personally, we don't have that much experience only being highschool students, but even the CS dojo and the QAF are technically
informal groups that have been created due to the complextiy and variation of programming. These tend to form because
each individual in the social structure may have holes in their knowledge but as a group, they can collectively fix all of that.
2.As far as I know, the terminal systems (Mac and Ubuntu) don't have built in communication, instead from our experience
external messneging communication is used.
3.Solo projects are often reffered to as "my program" but group projects are more referred to as "our" or "a" program.
4. I (Jude) have frequenlty blamed others in my head for programs that I myself know that I messed up, in addition to scheduling
however, I pretty quickly refer to self accoutability.
5. I have sometimes blamed bad luck, because sometimes a typo can set you back a decent margin. I'm not more or less lucky than
anyone else, but I do feel that once in a while luck can set you back.

Additional 2-3 sentence:
Our group will stop referring to programs as "our program" and try to facilitate the common knowledge of every part of our
program. In addition, we will try to up our use of the cs dojo and QAF to further use the informal social structures to aid
in our programming
